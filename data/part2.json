The company's main annual harvest is lentils, a highly valued food grown worldwide. The lentil parasite, broomrape, has been an increasing concern for many years and is now becoming resistant to chemical controls. In addition, changes in climate favor the propagation and growth of the parasite. As a result, the parasite cannot realistically be exterminated, and it has become pandemic, with lentil yields falling globally. The CEO appreciates the seriousness of the situation and has set out a change in direction that is effectively a new business for the company. There are opportunities for new products and new markets. The company will use the fields for another harvest and will cease to process third-party lentils. Thus, the target market will change, and the end-products will be different and more varied. This is a major decision and the CEO has stated a desire to repurpose rather than replace so as to manage the risks and limit the costs. The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture practice based in its headquarters and uses the TOGAF standard as the method and guiding framework. The practice has an established Architecture Capability and uses iteration for architecture development. The CIO is the sponsor of the activity. The CIO has assigned the Enterprise Architecture team to this activity. At this stage there is no shared vision or requirements. Refer to the scenario.

The nature of the business is such that the data and the information stored on the company systems is their major asset and is highly condential. The company employees travel extensively for work and must communicate over public infrastructure using message encryption, VPNs, and other standard safeguards. The company has invested in cybersecurity awareness training for all its staff. However, it is recognized that even with good education as well as system security, there is a dependency on third-party suppliers of infrastructure and software. The company uses the TOGAF standard as the method and guiding framework for its Enterprise Architecture (EA) practice. The CTO is the sponsor of the activity. The Chief Security Ocer (CSO) has noted an increase in ransomware (malicious software used in ransom demands) attacks on companies with a similar prole. The CSO recognizes that no matter how much is spent on education, and support, it is likely just a matter of time before the company suffers a signicant attack that could completely lock them out of their information assets. A risk assessment has been done and the company has sought cyber insurance that includes ransomware coverage. The quotation for this insurance is hugely expensive. The CTO has recently read a survey that stated that one in four organizations paying ransoms were still unable to recover their data, while nearly as many were able to recover the data without paying a ransom.

The company produces many products that buyers use and enjoy. The company has announced a major change to its products that will occur over a four-year period. This change includes the introduction of digital products and services. An architecture to support this strategy has been finished, along with a roadmap for a set of projects to implement this significant change. This will be a cross-functional effort between the product design and software teams. It is planned to be developed in phases. The company faces a challenge in presenting and providing access to different services through its products and digital platforms while ensuring compliance with data privacy laws. In some countries and regions, the data residency requirements mean that the company has to store certain data within the region where it is collected. As a result, the company's application portfolio and infrastructure must connect with various cloud services and data repositories in different countries. The EA team has inherited the architecture used by the current products, some of which can be carried over to the new products. The EA team has started to define which parts of the architecture to carry forward. Enough of the Business Architecture has been defined so that work can commence on the Information Systems and Technology Architectures. Those architectures need to be defined to support the key digital services that the company plans to provide. The company uses the TOGAF Standard as the foundation for its Enterprise Architecture framework, and architecture development follows the purpose-based EA Capability model outlined in the TOGAF Series Guide: A Practitioner's Approach to Developing Enterprise Architecture Following the TOGAF ADM.

The company's main annual harvest is lentils, a highly valued food grown worldwide. The lentil parasite, broomrape, has been an increasing concern for many years and is now becoming resistant to chemical controls. In addition, changes in climate favor the propagation and growth of the parasite. As a result, the parasite cannot realistically be exterminated, and it has become pandemic, with lentil yields falling globally. The CEO appreciates the seriousness of the situation and has set out a change in direction that is effectively a new business for the company. There are opportunities for new products and new markets. The company will use the fields for another harvest and will cease to process third-party lentils. Thus, the target market will change, and the end-products will be different and more varied.
